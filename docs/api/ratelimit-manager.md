RateLimitManager
================

The `RateLimitManager` is responsible for managing rate limiting functionality in TornadoAPI Guard. It supports both in-memory rate limiting using timestamp tracking and distributed rate limiting using Redis.

___

Overview
--------

Rate limiting is an essential security feature that protects your API from abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specific time window. The `RateLimitManager` implements this functionality with the following features:

- **True sliding window algorithm**: Tracks individual request timestamps rather than simple counters
- **In-memory timestamp tracking**: Uses deques for efficient, chronological storage
- **Redis-based distributed rate limiting**: Optional support for distributed environments
- **Atomic Redis operations**: Uses Lua scripts for consistent counting across instances
- **Configurable limits and windows**: Set your own thresholds and time periods
- **Singleton pattern**: Ensures consistent state across requests
- **Automatic cleanup**: Expired timestamps are automatically removed

___

Example Usage
-------------

```python
import asyncio
import tornado.web
from tornadoapi_guard import SecurityConfig, SecurityHandler, SecurityMiddleware

config = SecurityConfig(
    rate_limit=100,
    rate_limit_window=60,
    enable_rate_limiting=True,
    enable_redis=True,
    redis_url="redis://localhost:6379/0"
)
middleware = SecurityMiddleware(config=config)


class ExampleHandler(SecurityHandler):
    async def get(self) -> None:
        self.write({"status": "ok"})


async def main() -> None:
    await middleware.initialize()
    app = tornado.web.Application(
        [(r"/", ExampleHandler)],
        security_middleware=middleware,
    )
    app.listen(8000)
    await asyncio.Event().wait()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Advanced Configuration
----------------------

Redis Integration
-----------------

When using Redis for distributed rate limiting, the handler creates sorted sets with the following pattern:

```text
{redis_prefix}rate_limit:rate:{client_ip}
```

Each entry in the sorted set represents a request timestamp. The keys automatically expire after twice the configured window duration.

Redis Lua Script
-----------------

The rate limiter uses a Redis Lua script for atomic operations in distributed environments:

1. Add the current timestamp to the sorted set
2. Remove timestamps outside the current window
3. Count the number of timestamps within the window
4. Set expiry for the key

This ensures that rate limiting is consistent even in high-concurrency environments.

___

Direct Access
-------------

You can also access the handler directly if needed:

```python
from tornadoapi_guard import rate_limit_handler

# Get the singleton instance
handler = rate_limit_handler(config)

# Reset all rate limits
await handler.reset()
```

___

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

- **In-memory rate limiting** has lower latency but doesn't work in distributed environments
- **Redis-based rate limiting** works across multiple instances but adds network overhead
- The sliding window algorithm ensures accurate rate limiting without traffic spikes at window boundaries
- Automatic cleanup of old timestamps prevents memory leaks
