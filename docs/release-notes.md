Release Notes
=============

___

v1.0.0 (2026-04-30)
-------------------

Initial public release — fail-secure by default (upstream), agent-stats surface, version reporting (v1.0.0)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Upstream behavior — `SecurityConfig.fail_secure` defaults to `True`** (inherited from `guard-core >= 3.0.0`). When any security check raises an unhandled exception, the request is blocked with HTTP 500 instead of logging and falling through. Restore the old behavior on deployments that depend on it via `SecurityConfig(fail_secure=False)`. Recommended posture: keep the new default, surface any check exceptions in your monitoring, and fix them — the alternative could mask serious bugs.
- **Added** — `SecurityMiddleware.agent_stats` read-only `@property` returning the agent's telemetry buffer state. Returns `{"enabled": False}` when no agent is wired; otherwise returns `{"enabled": True, **agent_handler.get_stats()}` exposing `events_dropped`, `metrics_dropped`, `circuit_breaker_state`, and other agent counters. No caching — fresh on each call. Lets app teams build health endpoints that surface agent-side drops and circuit-breaker trips without scraping the agent directly.
- **Added** — `from tornadoapi_guard import __version__` — package version is exported via `importlib.metadata.version("tornadoapi_guard")` with a `"0.0.0+unknown"` fallback if the package is not installed (development from source). Pairs with `guard-core >= 3.0.0`'s `SecurityConfig.agent_guard_version` so application code can wire the tornadoapi-guard version through to the agent for SaaS-side telemetry attribution: `SecurityConfig(agent_guard_version=__version__)`.
- **Public API** — `SecurityMiddleware.agent_stats` and `__version__` are part of the public surface from this first release.

v1.0.0 (2026-04-25)
-------------------

guard-core 2.0.0 protocol alignment (v1.0.0)
--------------------------------------------

### Changed

- `SecurityMiddleware.suspicious_request_counts` is now `dict[str, dict[str, int]]` to match the per-category counter shape introduced in guard-core 2.0.0. The middleware annotation is the only call site touched in the adapter; behaviour is delegated to guard-core which now stores counts grouped by detection category instead of a flat per-IP integer.

### Requires

- `guard-core>=2.0.0`. Adapter middleware updated to match the new `suspicious_request_counts: dict[str, dict[str, int]]` protocol shape. tornadoapi-guard does not call `detect_penetration_attempt` / `detect_penetration_patterns` directly so the new `DetectionResult` return type does not require code changes here. User code that didn't reach into the protocol internals is unaffected.

### Compat notes

- No public API changes on `SecurityMiddleware`. Users that read `middleware.suspicious_request_counts` directly will see the new nested mapping shape and should update their introspection accordingly.

___

v1.0.0 (2026-04-25, OTel hot-path)
----------------------------------

Integration fixes for OTel + enrichment pipeline (v1.0.0)
---------------------------------------------------------

### Fixed

- `SecurityMiddleware.initialize()` is now invoked on the first request via a `_ensure_initialized()` asyncio-lock guard inside `run_pre_processing()`. Previously the method existed but was never called, so `HandlerInitializer.initialize_agent_integrations()` never ran and the composite handler stayed `None`. Without this fix, no OTel span or Logfire log was ever emitted regardless of config.
- After composite construction, `self.agent_handler` is rebound from the bare `guard-agent` client to the composite. Downstream callers that receive `middleware.agent_handler` (most notably `guard_core.utils.extract_client_ip → send_agent_event`) now route through the composite, so enrichment and OTel see every event.
- `BehavioralContext` now receives `handler_initializer.behavior_tracker`, matching the guard-core 1.2.1 wiring. This closes the architectural gap so `guard.behavior.recent_event_count` populates end-to-end when `enable_enrichment=True`.

### Requires

- `guard-core>=1.2.1` for the matching OTLP endpoint normalization and `BehaviorTracker` wiring fixes. Install the latest with `uv add tornadoapi-guard guard-core` or `pip install -U tornadoapi-guard guard-core`.

### Compat notes

- No public API changes. `SecurityMiddleware.__init__` signature unchanged.

v1.0.0 (2026-04-24)
-------------------

Telemetry pipeline wiring fix (v1.0.0)
--------------------------------------

Adopts guard-core 1.1.0 and fixes a middleware wiring bug that prevented OpenTelemetry, Logfire, and event/metric/check-log muting from seeing anything emitted by the request-path security pipeline.

- **Fixed** — `SecurityMiddleware.__init__` previously constructed `SecurityEventBus(agent_handler, ...)` and `MetricsCollector(agent_handler, ...)` directly, using the bare `guard_agent` handler (or `None`). `middleware.initialize()` then called `HandlerInitializer.initialize_agent_integrations()` which built a `CompositeAgentHandler` that no code path ever reached, because the event bus / metrics collector were already frozen on the bare handler. As a result, every event emitted through the request pipeline (`SecurityEventBus.send_middleware_event`) and every request metric bypassed OTel, Logfire, and the configured `muted_event_types` / `muted_metric_types` filter. This release extracts event-bus construction into `_build_event_bus_and_contexts()`, which consults `handler_initializer.composite_handler` and uses `build_event_bus()` / `build_metrics_collector()` when the composite is available. `initialize()` re-invokes `_build_event_bus_and_contexts()` after `initialize_agent_integrations()` so the dependent contexts (`ResponseContext`, `ValidationContext`, `BehavioralContext`) bind to the post-init event bus.
- **Added** — `tests/test_middleware_wiring.py` — four regression tests that pin `mw.event_bus.agent_handler` and `mw.metrics_collector.agent_handler` to `CompositeAgentHandler` after `middleware.initialize()` when OTel or Logfire is enabled, and confirm all dependent contexts reference the post-init event bus.
- **Dependencies** — `guard-core>=1.1.0,<2.0.0`.
- **User-visible impact** — Users already setting `enable_otel=True` or `enable_logfire=True` on `SecurityConfig` were previously getting handler-path events only (ip_banned, rate_limited from `ip_ban_manager` / `rate_limit_handler`, etc.) — but never pipeline-path events (`penetration_attempt`, `authentication_failed`, `user_agent_blocked`, `https_enforced`, etc.) or request metrics (`guard.request.duration`, `guard.request.count`, `guard.error.count`). After this release, every event and every metric flows through the composite, which means OTel spans, Logfire logs, and all mute fields (`muted_event_types`, `muted_metric_types`, `muted_check_logs`) work as documented. No `SecurityConfig` changes required; existing configurations produce strictly more telemetry, not less.
