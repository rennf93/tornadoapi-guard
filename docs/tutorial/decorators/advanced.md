Advanced Security Decorators
============================

Advanced security decorators offer sophisticated controls for fine-tuning your application's security posture. These decorators allow you to implement time-based access rules, set up honeypots to trap malicious bots, and control suspicious pattern detection on a per-route basis.

All examples below assume the following setup exists once at module level:

```python
from tornadoapi_guard import (
    SecurityConfig,
    SecurityDecorator,
    SecurityHandler,
    SecurityMiddleware,
)

config = SecurityConfig()
middleware = SecurityMiddleware(config=config)
guard_deco = SecurityDecorator(config)
middleware.set_decorator_handler(guard_deco)
```

___

Time-Based Access Control
-------------------------

Restrict access to endpoints based on specific time windows. This is useful for APIs that should only be available during business hours or maintenance periods.

. Restrict to Business Hours
--------------------------

```python
class AdvancedBusinessHoursHandler(SecurityHandler):
    @guard_deco.time_window("09:00", "17:00", "EST")
    async def get(self) -> None:
        self.write(
            {"message": "Reports are only available during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM EST)"}
        )
```

. Maintenance Window
------------------

Only allow access during a specific maintenance window.

```python
class MaintenanceHandler(SecurityHandler):
    @guard_deco.time_window("01:00", "03:00", "UTC")
    async def post(self) -> None:
        self.write({"status": "Maintenance operations running"})
```

___

Honeypot Protection
-------------------

Set up "honeypot" fields in your forms or JSON payloads to detect and block bots. These fields are hidden from human users but are often filled out by automated scripts.

. Basic Honeypot
--------------

Add a honeypot field to a registration form. If a bot fills it, access is denied.

```python
class RegisterHandler(SecurityHandler):
    @guard_deco.honeypot_detection(trap_fields=["website_url"])
    async def post(self) -> None:
        self.write({"message": "User registered successfully"})
```

*In your frontend, you would hide the `website_url` field, for example, with `style="display:none"`.*

. Multiple Honeypot Fields
------------------------

Use multiple fields to increase the chances of trapping a bot.

```python
class ContactFormHandler(SecurityHandler):
    @guard_deco.honeypot_detection(trap_fields=["comments", "phone_number_alt"])
    async def post(self) -> None:
        self.write({"status": "Message sent"})
```

. JSON Payload Honeypot
-----------------------

Honeypots also work with JSON request bodies.

```python
class AdvancedHoneypotHandler(SecurityHandler):
    @guard_deco.honeypot_detection(
        ["honeypot_field", "trap_input", "hidden_field"]
    )
    async def post(self) -> None:
        self.write({"message": "Human user verified"})
```

___

Suspicious Pattern Detection Control
------------------------------------

Globally, TornadoAPI Guard may be configured to detect suspicious patterns in requests. This decorator allows you to override that setting for specific endpoints where the global rules may not be appropriate.

. Disable Detection for a Specific Route
--------------------------------------

If an endpoint accepts data that might trigger false positives (e.g., code snippets, complex user-generated content), you can disable suspicious pattern detection for it.

```python
class CodeSubmissionHandler(SecurityHandler):
    @guard_deco.suspicious_detection(enabled=False)
    async def post(self) -> None:
        self.write({"status": "Code submitted for review"})
```

. Explicitly Enable Detection
---------------------------

While detection is often enabled by default, you can use this decorator to make it explicit, improving code readability.

```python
class AdvancedSuspiciousHandler(SecurityHandler):
    @guard_deco.suspicious_detection(enabled=True)
    async def get(self) -> None:
        query = self.get_query_argument("query", default=None)
        self.write({"results": "Search results", "query": query})
```

___

Combining Advanced Decorators
-----------------------------

You can stack advanced decorators with each other and with other security decorators for robust, layered security.

. High-Security Endpoint
----------------------

This endpoint is only accessible during specific hours and is protected by a honeypot.

```python
class AdminConfigHandler(SecurityHandler):
    @guard_deco.time_window("10:00", "16:00", "UTC")
    @guard_deco.honeypot_detection(trap_fields=["admin_email_confirm"])
    @guard_deco.require_auth(type="bearer")
    async def post(self) -> None:
        self.write({"status": "Configuration updated"})
```

___

Error Handling
--------------

Advanced decorators integrate with the middleware's error handling:

- **403 Forbidden**:
  - When a request is outside the allowed `time_window`.
  - When a `honeypot_detection` field is filled.

. Custom Error Messages
---------------------

You can configure custom error messages in the `SecurityConfig`.

```python
config = SecurityConfig(
    custom_error_responses={
        403: "Access denied. Please check access times and ensure you are not a bot.",
    }
)
```

___

Best Practices
--------------

. Use Timezones Explicitly
------------------------

Always specify the timezone in `time_window` to avoid ambiguity, especially for applications serving a global user base.

```python
# Good: Explicit timezone
@guard_deco.time_window("09:00", "17:00", "America/New_York")

# Avoid: Relying on default UTC if your users are in different timezones
# @guard_deco.time_window("09:00", "17:00")
```

. Hide Honeypot Fields Effectively
--------------------------------

Ensure honeypot fields are truly hidden from human users using CSS or other frontend techniques. A visible honeypot field can confuse users and defeat its purpose.

. Be Strategic with Detection Control
-------------------------------------

Only disable `suspicious_detection` when necessary. Disabling it globally or on many endpoints can weaken your application's defenses against penetration attempts.

Next Steps
----------

Now that you've learned about advanced decorators, you can explore other decorators to build a comprehensive security strategy:

- **[Behavioral Analysis Decorators](behavioral.md)** - Monitor usage patterns and detect anomalies.
- **[Content Filtering](content-filtering.md)** - Validate and sanitize request data.
- **[Rate Limiting Decorators](rate-limiting.md)** - Protect against brute-force and denial-of-service attacks.
